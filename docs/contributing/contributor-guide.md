## Development Principles

### Code Quality

- **Type Hints**: All functions typed
- **Docstrings**: Sphinx-style documentation
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Linting**: Ruff for style consistency

### Async First

- All API calls are async
- Use `asyncio` patterns
- Handle concurrency properly
- Avoid blocking operations

### Error Handling

- Structured error responses
- Proper logging at all levels
- Graceful degradation
- User-friendly messages
