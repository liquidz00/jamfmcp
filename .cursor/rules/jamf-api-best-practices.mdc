# Jamf API Integration and AI-Compatible Development

## Jamf API Best Practices
- Reference the official Jamf Pro Developer documentation for all API usage:
  - https://developer.jamf.com/
  - https://developer.jamf.com/classic_api
  - https://developer.jamf.com/jamf-pro/reference/
- Include links to relevant Jamf docs in comments or commit messages when implementing or updating API calls
- Prefer the Pro API over Classic API when possible, unless a feature is only available in the Classic API
- Follow authentication, pagination, and rate-limiting guidance as described in Jamf documentation

## OpenAPI Schema Usage
- Consult the official Jamf OpenAPI schema to understand expected request and response formats
- Parse or reference field types and structures from the schema to validate payloads
- Generate response models with Pydantic where possible to support explicit typing and schema validation

## Error Handling
- Catch only specific, expected exceptions:
  - requests.exceptions.HTTPError
  - requests.exceptions.ConnectionError
  - json.JSONDecodeError
  - Custom exceptions like JamfApiError
- Avoid general `except Exception` blocks unless absolutely necessary
- If a general exception is used:
  - Document the reasoning in a code comment
  - Log the full exception trace and request context
- Never use bare `except:` blocks
- Use structured logging for error traceability and AI observability

## AI Integration & Tooling Compatibility
- Write clear, composable functions with well-defined inputs and outputs
- Avoid hidden state and side effects where possible
- Use consistent naming conventions to help with code interpretation by LLMs and agents
- Annotate interfaces with type hints and docstrings to improve discoverability
- Design modules and utilities to be used independently or chained together as AI “playbooks”
- Document each function’s purpose, expected input shape, and output format for downstream use

## Observability and Logging
- Use Python’s `logging` module with structured output (e.g., JSON or key-value logs)
- Include contextual metadata in logs (e.g., API endpoint, serial number, device ID)
- Avoid printing sensitive information (e.g., tokens, user emails)
- Ensure logs can be parsed and analyzed by external tools or AI agents

## Async-First Development
- Write asynchronous functions and use `async`/`await` wherever possible, especially for:
  - API requests
  - File or network I/O
  - Concurrency across device or user workflows
- Prefer `httpx.AsyncClient` over `requests` for Jamf API integrations
- Use `asyncio.gather()` or task groups for concurrent workloads like batch device lookups or updates
- Only use synchronous code when:
  - Required by third-party libraries
  - Used in isolated CLI or script-entry wrappers
  - Performance or complexity tradeoffs make async unjustified
- Document rationale when reverting to synchronous methods

## Development Workflow
- Include test coverage for Jamf API client methods and error conditions
- Maintain up-to-date internal documentation or README sections for:
  - API usage patterns
  - Model generation strategies
  - Known edge cases and workarounds
- Encourage modularity to enable safe use by external agents or future automated integrations
